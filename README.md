# RU-Hungry Project
RUHungry simulates running a restaurant for a day. It loads a menu into parallel arrays of linked lists, stores ingredients in a chained hash table, and records orders/donations/restocks in a transaction linked list. It checks stock before selling, updates inventory/profit, builds table capacities, seats parties from a queue, and tracks who leaves.
